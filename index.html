<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <em>“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</em> The farmer said, <strong><em>“Maybe.”</em></strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <em>“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em> The farmer again said, <strong><em>“Maybe.”</em></strong></p> 

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <em>“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</em> and the farmer responded, <strong><em>“Maybe.”</em></strong> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <em>“Isn’t that great!”</em> Again, he said, <strong><em>“Maybe.”</em></strong></p>

<blockquote><q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="Good">good</span> or <span class="Bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q>

<h3>Conclusion </h3> 
<p><em><span class="Good">Good</span> and <span class="Bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</em></p>
